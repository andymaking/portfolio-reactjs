At the end of the day, user click through rate had gone up to 80% and users were 70% more comfortable and confident to buy online than to order on WhatsApp. This overwhelmingly positive feedback provided us with valuable insight into how we could further improve the user experience and also gave us the motivation to continue to refine the interface and make it even more user-friendly and efficient.",

However, after deliberations, we were able to agree that about 80% services were not in use and would best fit in later as features added on to enhance usability; once more research was done with the users to see the best way around displaying these services.\n\nSeeing as the present goal and need of these users was to search and shop, we tried to emphasize the need to have features and functionalities that improved this goal without making the system slow. Among budgetary considerations and timeline pressures, we also discussed the possibilities of rolling out these other services as part of beta tests in the future to see how users would respond to seeing them.\n\nHowever, some of the things we would fix included:",

However, this accomplishment was not without its challenges. One of the major obstacles was the need to design a website that was both visually appealing and user-friendly while still being abe to cater for the needs of the users - to seamlessly buy from the platform.\n\nTo overcome this challenge, we learned the importance of striking a balance between aesthetics and functionality. We realized that a visually stunning website with poor navigation and layout would not achieve the desired results. Thus, we focused on creating a design that was not only visually attractive but also easy to navigate and understand.\n\nAdditionally, we aimed to design a website that had all the must-have features and functionalities without overwhelming users with too many unwanted options.\n\nDespite these challenges, we were able to create a website that not only met the business requirements but also exceeded their expectations. The lessons learned from these challenges helped us to create a design that was not only visually stunning but also user-friendly and informative. The end result was a website that achieved its objectives and helped FirstMedtrade to grow its business.",
